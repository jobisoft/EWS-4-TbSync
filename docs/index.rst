About this Documentation
========================

This document tries to cover all aspects of how to create a provider add-on for TbSync to extends its sync capabilities. All TbSync provider add-ons are currently designed as *bootrapped extensions*, for which support is probably going to be dropped from Thunderbird at some time. We are working on migrating the TbSync API into a WebExtension API, so - hopefully - all provider add-ons can be converted into `MailExtensions <https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/about-add-ons#mailextensions>`_ without much effort.
